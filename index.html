Dyslexia is a reading disorder which is mostly detected by linguistic features and/or bad grades at school. Therefore, our goal  is  to  design  a  game  to  predict  the  risk  of  having  dyslexia  with  musical  and  visual  elements.   Hence,  we present the game <b>DysMusic</b> which aims to predict the risk of having dyslexia with musical elements.  The advantages of <b>DysMusic</b> are that the game is language independent and for  pre-readers. DysMusic was  designed  with  the  help  offive children and five parents who tested the game using the think aloud protocol and being observed while playing.
