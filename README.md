# DysMusicMusicalElements
Dyslexia is a reading disorder which is mostly detected by linguistic features and/or bad grades at school. Therefore, our goal is to design a game to predict the risk of having dyslexia with musical and visual elements. Hence, we present the game **DysMusic** which aims to predict the risk of having dyslexia with musical elements.The advantages of DysMusic are that the game is language independent and for pre-readers. **DysMusic** was designed with the help of five children and five parents who tested the game using the think aloud protocol and being observed while playing.
